# Finish Game logic

* when clicking on answer, check if answer is correct, update points and go to next question
* if on last question, tell the user his score and restart the game with new questions (api returns random questions each time you call it)
* At the moment the correct answer is always the first answer, shuffle them to make it random

# Refactor code
* Some parts of the code are unnecessary, overcomplicated and hard to read. Refactor the code.
* Sometimes the displayed text has weird characters, check why and display them correctly

# Design
* Style the app. Highlight things that are clickable. Make important things easy readable. Use tailwinds classes wherever its possible

# If you have some extra time:
* Go to the API website and generate a new url with any type of question: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php
* Design a new component for the yes/no question type
* Change the QuizQuestion.vue to be able to display both types of questions
